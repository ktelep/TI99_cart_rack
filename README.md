These are racks that are sized to hold cartridges for the TI-99/4a home computer system.  Three sizes are provided (4,6,8 cartridges)

Assemble them by cutting 2 'top' and 1 'bottom' for the size you need and then use M3 screws and standoffs to separate them.  

I've found using a 20mm standoff between the top and middle, then a 10mm standoff between the middle and bottom are a perfect fit.

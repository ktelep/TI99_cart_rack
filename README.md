These are racks that are sized to hold cartridges for the TI-99/4a home computer system.  Three sizes are provided for 4, 6, or 8 cartridge racks.  Feel free to modify for your particular needs.

Assemble them by cutting 2 'top' (one will become the middle) and 1 'bottom' for the size you need and then use M3 screws and standoffs to separate them.  

I've found using a 20mm standoff between the top and middle, then a 10mm standoff between the middle and bottom are a perfect fit.

Files are DXF for most compatiblity, they'll load right into K40 whisperer, units are in mm.
